                About the Captain Cool/M.S.Dhoni
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛ M.S. Dhoni, in full Mahendra Singh Dhoni, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India),
                Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national
                team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011.<br><br>
                
                ☛ Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings of 
                \148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team,
                where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single innings) against Pakistan..<br><br>
                
                ☛With Mahendra Singh Dhoni announcing his international retirement, a Dhoni-sceptic-turned-devotee reflects on the 
                providential career of Indian cricket’s most decorated leader. The hallmark of greatness is its tendency to be taken 
                for granted, to make the world believe in its inevitability. To convince its audience that no matter the context, 
                the circumstance or the characters, greatness will prevail in its challenges, almost always. For more than 15 years, M
                ahendra Singh Dhoni represented this exact greatness, frequently converting the impossible into the inevitable, 
                calmly throbbing along as the beating heart of a sport that billions of Indians expect to be synonymous with success.<br><br>
                
                ☛ A mere 22 runs from his first four One Day international innings for India made grim reading for Dhoni. As someone who had 
                just started following cricket as a kid, I took Dhoni for an aberration— an unrefined slogger in a pool of sophisticated 
                Indian strokemakers. Haplessly run out for a duck on debut and dismissed through naive shot selection in the next few games, 
                Dhoni seemed doomed to fail. I wondered why he had been preferred over the prodigious Parthiv Patel and the more aesthetically 
                pleasing Dinesh Karthik.
                
                <br><br> ☛ Soon enough, I stopped wondering. And so did the rest of his doubters. In his fifth ODI, against Pakistan, Dhoni, 
                promoted to bat at three by an apparently whimsical call from then skipper Sourav Ganguly, smashed a swashbuckling 148, 
                rewriting records for an Indian wicket-keeper-batsman. A string of explosive, match-finishing knocks followed, as Dhoni 
                launched an arsenal of missiles from his bat to demolish all questions surrounding his technique and temperament.
                
                <br><br> ☛ Dhoni was not conventionally improper, he just had his own skill set and style, which had been harnessed on the dusty 
                fields of Ranchi instead of the rarefied academies of India’s metropolitan cities. Dhoni was not a carefree maverick who 
                delighted in pummelling the bowling attack, but a calculated big-hitter who combined force and fearlessness with a demonstrable 
                urge to control his own fate.Breaking into the Indian team from the cricketing backwaters of Jharkhand in a generation of 
                astoundingly gifted players, required daring and determination. Dhoni had plenty of both, plus the street-smartness that came 
                with managing one of the world’s longest railway platforms. In making his journey from a ticket-collector to India’s latest superstar, 
                Dhoni had proven that he was in charge of his own destiny. He alone would write his remarkable script.
                
                <br><br> ☛ No single image encompasses the aura around Dhoni better than the shot of his eyes as he hit the World Cup-winning six at 
                the Wankhede Stadium in April 2011. His unflinching gaze, as it tracked the flight of the ball into the stands, symbolised his 
                obsession with the entire process of his profession. Whereas others would have blinked in ecstasy, Dhoni did not lose sight of the ball, 
                even when glory was guaranteed.
                
                <br><br> ☛ Over the years, Dhoni’s triple act as wicket-keeper-batsman-captain involved dealing with pressure on a daily basis. But Dhoni 
                had learnt to make pressure his oxygen. Taking a match deep had become his trademark, for he was aware that the one who cracked under 
                stress earlier would be the one who lost. Faced with Dhoni’s shovel-esque bat and computer-esque brain, it was his opponents who invariably 
                panicked first.
                
                <br><br> ☛ The man who had toyed with time on the pitch — slowing it down with his paraphernalia of rituals before taking guard — had 
                transcended it for a while, allowing everyone else to take stock and reflect. Destiny, which had finally struck back at Dhoni in robbing 
                him of a World Cup final last year, had yet again been mastered, directed to provide a flood of nostalgia in the middle of a pandemic 
                on an Independence Day like no other. In hindsight, like many of Dhoni’s masterstrokes, it seemed the obvious thing to do, the obvious 
                way to go. So obvious that nobody saw it coming.
                
                <br><br> ☛ As I eventually stopped watching the video on loop, it hit me how Dhoni had, in keeping with his temporal precision, mentioned 
                “1929 hrs” as the particular moment in time after which he was to be considered “Retired”. For someone who always lived in the present, 
                Dhoni had owned the moment once more. Not simply owned it, but frozen it in time, capturing his legacy as a cricketing champion in a capsule, 
                even as the rest of his incredible life story keeps ticking along.
